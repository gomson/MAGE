Does the MAGE logo refer to a "Black Mage" of Final Fantasy?
- Apparently, the author of the full image intended to portray a "Black Mage" of the Final Fantasy game series. 
I, however, never played any Final Fantasy game and nor was I aware of the existence of these characters till some friend pointed this out at first glance. 
So for me, the logo just represents a mysterious, unknown mage and not some reference to a particular game or game series.
